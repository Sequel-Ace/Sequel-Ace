/// Crack Prevention</a>:
/// App Store binaries are signed by both their developer and Apple. This encrypts the binary so
/// that decryption keys are needed in order to make the binary readable. When iOS executes the
/// binary, the decryption keys are used to decrypt the binary into a readable state where it is
/// then loaded into memory and executed. iOS can tell the encryption status of a binary via the
/// cryptid structure member of LC_ENCRYPTION_INFO MachO load command. If cryptid is a non-zero
/// value then the binary is encrypted.
///
/// 'Cracking' works by letting the kernel decrypt the binary then siphoning the decrypted data into
/// a new binary file, resigning, and repackaging. This will only work on jailbroken devices as
/// codesignature validation has been removed. Resigning takes place because while the codesignature
/// doesn't have to be valid thanks to the jailbreak, it does have to be in place unless you have
/// AppSync or similar to disable codesignature checks.
