### Core Features

In the articles below we take you through the important screens that make up Sequel Ace and allow you to manage your databases and tables.

#### Frequently Asked Questions

**Is there a shortcut for running a Query?**

Yes.
If you press `⌘ + R` it will run all the commands in the Query view.
If you press `⌘ + ⌥ + R` it will run either the currently selected text as a query OR the entire query in which you are currently positioned.

**How do I create an enum field in a table?**

To create an _enum_ field follow the same procedure as you would for any other field, choose _enum_ in the _Type_column of the Table Structure form, and then in the _Length_ column enter the enum values as comma separated quoted strings. If you wish to use a default value, you should enter it without quotes in the _Default_ column.

**Where does Sequel Ace store the connections?**

The connections strings are stored in the following preference file:

~/Library/Containers/com.sequel-ace.sequel-ace/Data/Library/Preferences/com.sequel-ace.sequel-ace.plist

The passwords are stored in the Mac OSX Keychain, which is stored here:

~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain

Find more info about the Keychain here: [http://nevali.net/post/122592107/managing-the-mac-os-x-keychain](http://nevali.net/post/122592107/managing-the-mac-os-x-keychain "http://nevali.net/post/122592107/managing-the-mac-os-x-keychain").

The \~/Library folder is invisible in Lion, to open it choose "Go To Folder…" (`⌘ + ⇧ + G`) and type "~/Library/Preferences/" to open the preference folder.
