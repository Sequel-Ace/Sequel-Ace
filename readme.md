## Branches

- main: Main is our active development branch. All contribution PRs should be pointed at main!

## Tags & Releases

- production/ tags represent submissions to the macOS App Store. These are marked as "Pre-Release" until approved by Apple and officially released by the team. Both release candidates and final releases use production/ tags. Release candidates will have RC or Release Candidate in their title.
- beta/ tags represent pre-release versions of Sequel Ace that are intended to test new features and bug fixes. The downloadable app in a beta/ tag has a different name and identifier (Sequel Ace Beta), meaning you can install it side-by-side with the latest App Store release. Beta releases also have increased logging turned on to help us identify critical issues.

## Compatibility

- **macOS:** >= 10.12
- **Processor:** Intel & Apple Silicon
- **MySQL:** >= 5.6
- **MariaDB:** >= 10.0

_Note: An [older version of Sequel Ace (version 2.3.2)](https://github.com/Sequel-Ace/Sequel-Ace/releases/tag/production%2F2.3.2-2121) is available to download for macOS versions 10.10 and 10.11, however support is limited and we encourage upgrading to the latest macOS and Sequel Ace._
