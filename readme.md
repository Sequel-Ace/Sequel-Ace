## Branches

- main: Main is our active development branch. All contribution PRs should be pointed at main!

## Tags & Releases

- production/ tags represent submissions to the macOS App Store. These are marked as "Pre-Release" until approved by Apple and officially released by the team. Both release candidates and final releases use production/ tags. Release candidates will have RC or Release Candidate in their title.
- beta/ tags represent pre-release versions of Sequel Ace intended to test new features and bug fixes. The downloadable app in a beta/ tag has a different name and identifier (Sequel Ace Beta), meaning you can install it side-by-side with the latest App Store release. Beta releases also have increased logging turned on to help us identify critical issues.
